    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is <strong>knitting</strong>. I learned to knit from my mother when I was in elementary school. She taught me the <em>very</em> basics, so I'm not that skilled, though I wish I was. Unfortunately, I don't knit as much as I used to or I'd like to.</p>
    <h3>Other Things I Like</h3>
    <p>I <em>really</em> enjoy playing sports. The sports I play include <b>lacrosse</b> and <b>tennis</b>. I also <i>love</i> to read. Some of my favorite books are <strong>"Fahrenheit 451"</strong> and <strong>"The Trumpet of the Swan"</strong>.</p>
